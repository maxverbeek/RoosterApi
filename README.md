RoosterApi
==========

An easy to use, roster API for the repro school site.

An example is provided in the index.php file.

I have __not__ attempted to make the example look nice in any way, simply becouse I can't be bothered to.


Resources
=========

This API uses the following classes:

* DOMdocument
* DOMXpath

This API will not work if you don't have access to these classes.
